/**
 * Scoped push credentials and commit attribution (self-build slice AM,
 * EW-810) — the rules BOTH ends of the fleet share about how a node is
 * allowed to write to a remote, and whose name goes on the commit.
 *
 * ## The gap this module closes
 *
 * Until this slice a fleet node's `git push` was token-free by design:
 * the machine's own Git credential helper answered for it. In practice
 * that is a long-lived personal access token in the OS credential store
 * with write access to EVERY repository the service account can reach.
 * The platform could not scope it to one run, could not rotate it, could
 * not revoke it when a laptop was lost, and could not even observe that
 * it had been used. Six unattended machines each held one.
 *
 * What replaces it is a GitHub App INSTALLATION token, minted per job
 * over the node-authenticated job channel, narrowed to the repository
 * ids this job actually needs and to `contents: write` alone. It reaches
 * the node in one HTTPS response, lives in that process's memory for the
 * length of one commit-and-push, rides into `git` as an
 * `http.<url>.extraheader` carried in the CHILD ENVIRONMENT (never argv,
 * never a config file, never a remote URL), and is revoked at GitHub the
 * moment the run ends.
 *
 * ## Why the token is not on the payload
 *
 * Slice Y established that a value which reaches the job PAYLOAD reaches
 * the job row, the lease response, the job view and `fleet_jobs.result`.
 * So the payload carries no credential and no request for one: the node
 * asks for it on the authenticated channel, authorised — exactly as
 * slice Z's MCP credential is — by HOLDING THE LEASE.
 *
 * ## Attribution that cannot be forged
 *
 * Every fleet commit used to be authored `Ever Works Agent
 * <agent@ever.works>` on every machine, so Git history could not answer
 * WHICH node or WHICH agent produced a change. This module defines the
 * author/committer split (author = the Agent, committer = the node) and
 * a reserved `Ever-Works-` trailer namespace.
 *
 * The commit MESSAGE is payload-supplied and may contain newlines, so a
 * Task title could otherwise write trailer-shaped lines of its own and
 * claim a machine the run never used. {@link composeFleetPushCommitMessage}
 * REFUSES such a message rather than appending after it: a trailer a
 * reader cannot distinguish from ours is worse than no trailer at all.
 */

/**

 * `git` resolves and its version accepts environment-carried
 * configuration (`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`, Git >= 2.31), which is the
 * mechanism the credential is installed through.
 *
 * It is a promise the node can keep, in the sense
 * `apps/node/src/core/capabilities.ts` means: the same fact that turns
 * the tag on is the fact the push depends on. A node without it is never
 * handed `agent-task` work, which is the point — the alternative is
