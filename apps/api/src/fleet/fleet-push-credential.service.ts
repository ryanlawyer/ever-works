/**
 * Scoped push credentials (self-build slice AM, EW-810) — the platform
 * half of `POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/push-credential`.
 *
 * ## What this service is for
 *
 * A fleet node's `git push` used to be authenticated by the machine's own
 * Git credential helper: a long-lived personal access token, in the OS
 * credential store, with write access to every repository that OS user
 * can reach. The platform could not scope it, rotate it, revoke it or
 * observe it. This service replaces it with a GitHub App INSTALLATION
 * token, minted per job, narrowed to the repository ids the job actually
 * writes to and to `contents: write` alone.
 *
 * ## The rules this file exists to keep
 *
 * - **The scope comes from PLATFORM STATE.** The repositories are read
 *   from the job's own `payload.workspace` — which the PLANNER wrote, so
 *   this is the platform re-reading its own decision, the same posture
 *   `FleetRunCredentialService.bridgeRequested` takes — and then resolved
 *   against `github_app_installation_repositories`, the snapshot
 *   `GitHubAppSyncService` keeps from GitHub. The numeric repository ids
 *   the token is narrowed by come from THAT table, never from a name a
 *   node or a payload supplied.
 * - **The installation must belong to the job's owner.** `findByFullName`
 *   is global — it returns rows for every installation in the deployment —
 *   so an ownership filter is the only thing between a job and a token for
 *   somebody else's repository.
 * - **Fail closed, with a stable reason.** No App configured, no
 *   installation covering every repository, two installations, a suspended
 *   or deleted installation, a GitHub refusal: each is a refusal the node
 *   turns into a failed run that NAMES the gap. There is no fallback to
 *   the node's ambient helper — that fallback is the hole this closes.
 * - **Nothing about the token is logged, stored or echoed.** The log line
 *   names the job, the node and the repositories. The token exists in this
 *   process for the length of one response and is never written anywhere.
