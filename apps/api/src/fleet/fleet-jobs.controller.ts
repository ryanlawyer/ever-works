/**
 * Fleet job lease protocol (Desktop PRD §6.2 / M4) — the endpoints an
 * enrolled node calls to actually DO work.
 *
 * All three are `@Public()` and self-authenticating with the SAME node
 * secret minted at enrollment: the credential is in the body, checked
 * constant-time against the stored sha256, and every invalid path
 * (unknown node, disabled node, still-enrolling node, wrong secret,
 * someone else's job, terminal job) collapses to ONE undifferentiated
 * 401. That is deliberate — a differentiated error here would let an
 * attacker with a random uuid enumerate which nodes and jobs exist.
 *
 * The ONE differentiated answer is `409 { reason: 'stale-lease' }`
 * (suspend-safe leases, self-build finding R7), and it is reachable only
 * by an authenticated node that IS the recorded holder of an active job
 * but echoes a `leaseGeneration` that is no longer current — its claim
 * lapsed while the machine slept and was re-issued. Nothing a foreign,
 * unknown or superseded node sends can produce it, so it reveals nothing
 * the 401 posture was protecting. The service throws it; nothing here
 * catches it.
 *
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/lease          atomic CAS claim, capability-filtered
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/heartbeat  extend the claim (leased → running)
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/complete   report success or failure
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/env-files  fetch the run's seed .env contents
 *
 * The fourth route (run secrets, self-build slice Y) takes the SAME
 * posture, deliberately: it is the only place a decrypted secret leaves
 * the platform for a node, so it proves the claim with the same four
 * checks `complete` uses (credential, recorded holder, active status,
 * current lease generation) rather than inventing a second scheme. Its
 * REQUEST carries only registry row ids and file paths; the response body
 * is the one value-bearing shape in the whole channel, and nothing about
 * it is persisted, logged or echoed into the job.
 *
 * A resolution refusal (`FleetRunSecretsError` — unknown/disabled row, a
 * path the row no longer carries, a decrypt failure, the instance kill
 * switch) answers 422 with a STABLE machine token, never a partial file
 * list: a run that starts with half its environment fails as if the code
 * were broken, which is the failure this route exists to remove.
 *
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/mcp-credential          mint a run-scoped token
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/mcp-credential/revoke   drop it early
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/push-credential         mint a scoped write token
 *
 * The push credential (self-build slice AM) takes the env-files posture
 * exactly: the same four checks, a 422 with a stable token on refusal, and
 * no partial answer. It is the second place a secret leaves the platform
 * for a node, and the first place one leaves that can WRITE — so it is
 * scoped from platform state alone (this job's repositories,
 * `contents: write`, under the hour) and there is no degraded path back to
 * the machine's own credential helper.
 *
 * Throttles are sized for polling: a node with a 5-second idle poll
 * needs ~12 lease calls/minute, and job heartbeats fire at a third of
 * the lease TTL, so the limits accommodate a busy multi-node fleet
 * without letting one credential hammer the API.
 *
 * Separate controller from `FleetController` on purpose: registry
 * management (owner-scoped, session-authenticated) and the work channel
 * (node-authenticated, public) are two different trust boundaries and
 * should not share a class.
 *
 * **Guards.** `FleetEnabledGuard` gates the whole surface on
 * `FLEET_ENABLED` (404 when off — a disabled deployment does not admit
 * the channel exists). `FleetNodeAuthGuard` then authenticates the node
 * credential BEFORE any handler runs, so the trust boundary is
 * declarative at the edge instead of implicit inside each service call.
 * The service still re-verifies: the guard is the edge contract, the
 * service is the invariant, and neither is allowed to be the only check.
