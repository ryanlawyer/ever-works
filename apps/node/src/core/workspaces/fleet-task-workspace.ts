	 * repository-scoped installation token minted for THIS job over the
	 * node-authenticated channel, installed for the single `git push`
	 * child through its environment, and dropped when the run ends. A
	 * finalize that intends to publish and has no such credential is
	 * REFUSED (`push-credential`) rather than falling back — see

	 * block records the node, agent, job and run. Both come from platform
	 * state on the same authenticated response as the credential.
	 *

 * CLI was granted the mount as an additional directory. This runs in the
 * node process, which no CLI sandboxes, so its verdict is identical whether
