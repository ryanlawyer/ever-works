/**
 * The node worker host: lease → execute → report, forever, until stopped.
 *
 * This is the loop that finally makes an enrolled machine *capacity*
 * rather than inventory. Before it, `apps/node` could enroll, heartbeat
 * and report its capability tags, and no Task could ever run on it.
 *
 * ## Design rules
 *
 * - **Outbound-only, like every other node channel** (PRD §6.1): the
 *   node polls; nothing ever connects in. No port is opened.
 * - **The lease is a deadline, not a lock.** While a job runs, a
 *   keep-alive extends the claim at a third of the TTL. If this process
 *   dies, nothing has to notice — the claim lapses and the platform
 *   re-offers the work.
 * - **A job always produces a verdict.** An executor that throws is
 *   reported as a job FAILURE, and a kind with no registered executor is
 *   failed immediately naming the kind. Dropping it silently would leave
 *   the job to expire and retry forever on the same incapable node. The
 *   one exception is deliberate and narrow: an executor that DECLINED to
 *   finish — it withheld an irreversible write it may no longer be
 *   entitled to make — hands the job back through `JobLeaseHandle.defer`
 *   and nothing is reported, because both terminal states would be a lie
 *   about work nobody ran to a conclusion.
 * - **Graceful shutdown drains.** `stop()` stops leasing at once, then
 *   awaits in-flight jobs so their results are REPORTED rather than
 *   abandoned to a lease expiry. A second stop while draining is a no-op.
 * - **So does pausing.** `pause()` is the same drain without the
 *   teardown: leasing halts synchronously, in-flight work runs to a
 *   verdict, and the loop keeps ticking so `resume()` needs no restart.
 *   Pausing is a state a running node is in, not a way to kill it.
 * - **Backoff is exponential with a ceiling**, so an API outage produces
 *   a slow retry rather than a hot loop against a dead endpoint.
 * - **A machine that slept through its lease stops itself** (suspend-safe
 *   leases, self-build finding R7). Desk PCs sleep; a suspended node
 *   stops beating, its lease lapses and the platform re-issues the job —
 *   while the model here keeps running and, without help, would push a
 *   branch against a claim it no longer holds. Two defences, both keyed
 *   on stable reasons from `@ever-works/contracts`:
 *     1. every timer this loop arms records when it was armed on BOTH
 *        clocks, and every lease poll records when it began; a tick that
 *        fires far later than armed, or a poll whose span is far longer
 *        than any awake request ({@link SUSPEND_GAP_THRESHOLD_MS}), is a
 *        resume, and every in-flight lease is re-checked: lapsed on the
 *        wall clock → the job is aborted (model process killed, nothing
 *        pushed, reported as `lease-lapsed-while-suspended`); still inside
 *        its claim → one immediate heartbeat re-confirms it with the
 *        platform;
 *     2. every heartbeat and report echoes the `leaseGeneration` the lease
 *        came with, and a `409 stale-lease` answer aborts the run at once
 *        and suppresses the follow-up report, which would only be refused
 *        again.
 *   Both are keyed on the RUN, not the job id: the first poll after a
 *   resume reclaims and re-leases the very job this node slept through
 *   (reclaim runs inline on the lease path), so the same id can be in
 *   flight twice — see {@link JobRun}.
 *
 * Timers and the transport are injected so the whole state machine is
 * testable without waiting on wall time or opening a socket.
