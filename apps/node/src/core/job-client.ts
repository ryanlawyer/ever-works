/**
 * HTTP client for the three node-facing fleet-job endpoints:
 *
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/lease           → claim queued work
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/heartbeat   → keep the claim alive
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/complete    → report the verdict
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/env-files   → fetch the run's seed .env files
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/mcp-credential          → mint a run token
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/mcp-credential/revoke   → drop it early
 *   POST /api/fleet/jobs/:id/push-credential         → mint a scoped write token
 *
 * Same posture as {@link FleetClient}: all three are `@Public()` and
 * self-authenticating (the `(nodeId, secret)` pair in the body IS the
 * credential); the server answers every invalid path with ONE
 * undifferentiated 401, and this client preserves that — it never
 * echoes a server body into an error message, so nothing about which
 * check failed can leak into a node's logs.
 *
 * The one differentiated answer is `409` (suspend-safe leases): the
 * `leaseGeneration` the node echoes on heartbeat/complete is no longer
 * the job's current one, so the claim it holds is void. It is mapped to
 * `FleetClientError('stale-lease')` from the STATUS alone — the body is
 * never read — and it is thrown rather than collapsed to null, because
 * the worker needs the reason to abort the run without reporting.
 *
 * Wire shapes come from `@ever-works/contracts`, not a local mirror:
 * this is the one part of the node↔platform contract that carries
 * executable work, and a silent drift here would mean a node running
 * the wrong thing rather than merely reporting the wrong status.
 *
 * `fetch` is injected rather than imported so every path is testable
 * without a network, and so the Electron main process can supply its own.
